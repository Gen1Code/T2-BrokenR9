# Differential Calculus - Broken R9 Custom Theory

A Custom Theory for the mobile game [Exponential Idle](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/), the API and samples that helped create this come from [here](https://github.com/conicgames/theory-sdk)
To see the theory in game enter this link after pressing the '+' icon in the Custom Theory tab: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gen1Code/T2-BrokenR9/main/T2BrokenR9.js

This CT is a modified version of [T2 - Differential Calculus](https://github.com/conicgames/theory-sdk/blob/main/samples/T2-DifferentialCalculus.js) by conicgames, it is modified so that the 9th Research affects all derivative steps demonstrating that it breaks the theory completely.
